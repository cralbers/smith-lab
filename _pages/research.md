The Smith Lab conducts research on a range of topics including heart failure, arrhythmia and cardio-oncology, using a variety of modern techniques. 

# How and why do anti-cancer treatments cause cardiotoxicity?

Cancer immunotherapy encompasses a growing class of drugs that aim to activate the body's own immune system to fight against cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) fall into this category, and aim to reactivate the body's immune system to target cancer. However, a growing body of research shows that while patients have increased cancer-free survival, they may also experience cardiotoxic side effects, ranging in severity from minor ECG abnormalities to fulminant myocarditis. 

To determine the underlying mechanisms that lead to the cardiotoxic side effects of ICIs, the Smith Lab employs novel and cutting edge techniques, such as utilization of induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes, cardiovascular optogenetics, and *in vivo* models to create and characterize clinically relevant models of the cardiotoxic side effects of ICIs.

# What molecular mechanisms contribute to arrhythmia and heart failure?

Cytoskeletal proteins play an essential role in the assembly of the cardiac junctional dyad. The cardiac dyad is responsible for the contraction of the heart through excitation-coupling, and if assembly of the dyad is disrupted, electrical signals will be uncoordinated, causing irregular heart contraction and arrhythmia. 

βII spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, associates with ankyrin-B and represents an integrative node for assembly of the cardiac junctional dyad. The Smith Lab has discovered a novel mutation in the human ankyrin-B gene that disrupts the ankyrin-B/βII spectrin interaction, leading to severe human arrhythmia phenotypes. Through the use of both *in vitro* and *in vivo* model systems, our research in this area focuses on mechanistic characterization of the ankyrin-B/βII spectrin interaction and the downstream effects of its disruption.
