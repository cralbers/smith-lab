The Smith Lab conducts research on a range of topics including heart failure, arrhythmia and cardio-oncology. 

# How and why do anti-cancer treatments cause cardiotoxicity?


# What molecular mechanisms contribute to arrhythmia and heart failure?

Cytoskeletal proteins play an essential role in the assembly of the cardiac junctional dyad. The cardiac dyad is responsible for the contraction of the heart through excitation-coupling, and if assembly of the dyad is disrupted, electrical signals will be uncoordinated, causing irregular heart contraction. \
βII spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein, associates with ankyrin-B and represents an integrative node for assembly of the cardiac junctional dyad. The Smith Lab has discovered a novel mutation in the human ankyrin-B gene that disrupts the ankyrin-B/βII spectrin interaction, leading to severe human arrhythmia phenotypes.
